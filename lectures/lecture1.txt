# reference material -> Simplified ARM block diagram

- Register file
    - R13: SP
        - stack pointer
    - R14: LR
        - link Register
    - R15: PC
        - program counter
- Data cache
    - fast and close piece of memory
- Instruction cache
    - fast and close piece of memory for instructions

- ALU
    - input can be any of the GPR registers
    - output can go to any register, one that we specify

- "Immediate" means that the value is stored inside the instruction itself

- Technical Reference Manual shows all the commands usable in the specific chip

- GDB
    - breakpoint at the function that is defined in assembly
    - step function to step into assembly
    - i r (inspect register)
    - i r r0 r1 (inspect register r0 and r1)
